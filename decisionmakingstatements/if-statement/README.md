* This is basically a "one-way" descision statement.

* This is used when we have only one alternative.

       if(expression)
       {
          True part
          statement1;
       }
       Rest of the code;
       
* Firstly,the expression is evaluated to true or false.only  if the expression is true then true  part statements will be executed.
