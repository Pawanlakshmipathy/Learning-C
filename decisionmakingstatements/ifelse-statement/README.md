# if else statement

* This is basically a "two-way" decision statement.
* This is used when we must choose between two alternatives.
         
The syntax is shown below:

          if(expression)
         {
            True part
            statement1;
         }
         else
         {
            False part
            statement2:
         }
         Rest of the code;

* Firstly,the expression is evaluated to true or false.Only if the expression is true then true  part statements will be executed otherwise false part statements are executed.
* The flow diagram is shown below:
